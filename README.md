This framework helps you to:

* design interfaces for futuristic smart screens, touch tables and HUDs.
* implement user interfaces for long life application and productivity based on maximum ergonomy and timeless design
* increase efficiency with adaptive interfaces based on human experience

> This project is still in development so do not hesitate to involve yourself.

## Getting started

```bash
$ npm install react-aldebarion
```

## Guidelines

### Efficiency

* give priority to efficiency
* long-term interface

### Multi devices

* ensure responsiveness compatible with all platforms including computers, smartphone, tablets, large screens, ambient devices and HUDs.
* use a minimal set of contrasted colors to manage even the most lightning environments
* ensure continuity between devices: the user can begin on one device and then switch to another device without degradation of experience


### Ergonomy

* accompany the look of the user: display everything with transition
* do not use no frills except to catch the user attention
* integrate several levels of reading

### Adaptation to user

* make interface adaptable/adaptive to user
