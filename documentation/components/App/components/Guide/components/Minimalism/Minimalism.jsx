            With minimalism, Aldebarion wants software applications
            to give back the freedom to the user and
            to help him saving time instead of manipulating him.
            At the opposite of a lot of apps, softwares using Aldebarion should be designed to
            to save user time and so should incitate the user to use them the less possible.

          <p>
            In order to make it, Aldebarion gives the priority to efficiency over emotional design.
            So it doesn't fit all applications but helps to focus on what
            really matters.

            All designed components are designed with geometric shapes, right angles and only few
            colors. But each difference of colors is symbolic and represents something: a disabled
            state, a wrong value, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            So even if components are designed to be minimalist, they should contain a lot
            of features to
            make the user experience as much as efficient as possible.
