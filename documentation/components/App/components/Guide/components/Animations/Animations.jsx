            These apparition animations may be splitted in to part. The first part is to make
            the components appearing one after an other. A third party library
            like <Link href="https://github.com/friedrith/react-progressive-entrance">react-progressive-entrance</Link> may
            be used.

            For widgets composed of multi parts, it is also useful to make them appearing
            progressively like a <strong>transformer</strong>. It gives a little time to the
            user to understand
            all parts of the components and so be more efficient when usint it.

            Default Aldebarion components have a property <strong>animated</strong> that create this
            kind of effect.

            This kind of animations comes also with the absence of animations when a component
            is not interactive to explain the exact opposite to the user. It very important
            for disabled components that cannot be clicked by the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            It it also important to give a feedback to the user everytime an action is in progress.
            It
            helps him to understand that his requests has been taken into account and that
            the application is currently working. It avoid questioning, hesitation and frustration.

            Aldebarion has also several special components to help you create smooth
